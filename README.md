Initial Setup 
1. Sign up for an account by clicking "Get Started" or log in through Github!
2. Proceed to the Projects tab.

Creating a Project and Connecting Your Databases (Only Owners and Admins Can Connect Databases to a Project)
1. In the left side panel on the projects page, click the buttons underneath "Choose Project" to create a new project.
2. Select the "Migrations" tab in the top navigation bar and press the database icon to create a new database. Enter your connection string and database name, then click the "Add"    button.
3. Congratulations, your database is good to go!

Adding Members, Removing Members and Updating Roles for Members.
(Only Owner and Admin roles will have these functions)
1. Adding team members:
    a. In the projects page, after selecting a project, you can click generate and an access code will be stored to that specific project. *** Only Owner and Admin roles will be          able to generate access codes ***
    b. Give the code to members you want to give access to your project and its databases.
    c. Members will now sign up on Ditto as well and when they get to the projects page, they will click join project and enter the access code.
    d. If successful, they should be able to see the project and see themselves as "User" role.

2. Removing project members:
    a. Select your project and press the Remove User button in the Role column.

3. Updating project member roles:
    a. Select your project, then use the drop-down menu to assign roles to the corresponding users.

Adding, Updating and Deleting Migration Scripts.
1. Adding:
    a. On your migrations page, click the "Add" button above the migration scripts table.
    b. On the add migrations page, enter your version, description, and script in the code editor. When you're ready, click "Add."
    c. Your newly created migration should appear with a pending status (it will only execute when you're ready).

2. Updates:
    a. If you want to make any updates to the version, description, or script, highlight the specific migration script you'd like to edit (it should turn purple) and press the            edit icon underneath the code editor.
    b. This will take you to the updates page where you can make your changes.

3. Delete:
    a. If there are any migration scripts you want to delete, you can highlight by clicking a migration script and press the delete button under the code editor.

4. Execute:
    a. Once you're ready to execute your scripts, click the button under the dropdown in the Actions table.
    b. This will proceed to execute your scripts in the migration table in ascending order.
    c. If any errors occur, the execution will stop.

Deleting and Leaving Projects and Databases (Only Owners and Admins Can Delete Projects and Databases)
1. Deleting Projects:
    a. Select the project you wish to manage. You can either delete the project or leave it. Deleting will remove the project entirely from the database. Leaving the project will         only detach you as a user from the project, while the project remains intact for others.
2. Deleting Databases:
    a. Select the database you want to delete. Click the "Delete" button to erase the database from the project.
