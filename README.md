# Product Description
Ditto is a database schema migration version controller. It's intended use is for developers to work collaboritively and help maintain database changes and see what schema migration scripts were executed.
It allows for organization in for multiple projects and databases within those projects. This is the perfect visual tool for engineers who need to keep track of schema migrations so databases are functional and applications work properly before production.
